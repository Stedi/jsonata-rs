# Custom Test Suite

This directory uses the same structure as the forked `jsonata-js` test suite in
the sibling directory, but contains new test cases for bugs found while
developing this Rust implementation. We keep these separate from the forked test
suite so that we can easily pull in updates to the other test suite from
upstream.
